More Collections that I themed for RVGM Theme for Batocera https://github.com/Darknior/RVGM-BT-Theme
Drop the collections into the the 'RVGM theme folder' that you should already have in your 'theme' folder.
After that, I placed more configs in the share.zip.
Configs for the "Dynanmic Collections" I have setup.
Configs for the theme. My current config.
ONLY COLOR LOGOS. NO GREY LOGOS.
